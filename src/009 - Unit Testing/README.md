# Unit testing

When using dependency injection, coupled with interfaces and seperating the logic and data, it becomes very easy to unit test a piece of logic. As you can split your logic in smaller units, each of those units become easier to test. It also enables the developer to test specific logic without having to test a large dependency graph.
